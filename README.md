# Petful Backend 

This backend was set up by cloning from https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/backend-template

There is a get and delete enpoint set up for both /api/dog and /api/cat endpoints.

No API key needed. 

No database has been implemented yet. Animal data stored in queues in index.js.

If you would like to implement knex or mongo you can easily as there are both a db-knex.js and db-mongoose.js file to get you hooked up.
